# QR Auth â€“ NFT-Based Serial Number Verification via QR Code

**QR Auth** is a blockchain-powered service that uses NFTs to register and verify serial numbers of high-value devices. After minting, a unique QR code is generated that can be placed on physical products. Scanning the QR allows public verification of the productâ€™s authenticity and ownership history.

- **Sale of Fake or Stolen Goods**  
  Unauthorized sellers list counterfeit or stolen items online that appear genuine due to reused serials.

- **Pre-Owned Sold as New**  
  Previously used products are repackaged and sold as new, misleading customers and violating warranties.

These cases reveal the need for secure, verifiable, and tamper-proof product identifiers.

## Who It's For

- **Consumers** â€“ Scan and verify before buying any high-value item
- **Manufacturers** â€“ Prevent warranty fraud and track original devices
- **Retailers & Resellers** â€“ Prove authenticity of pre-owned or refurbished goods

## Why NFTs and QR Codes?

- **Immutable** â€“ NFTs guarantee that serials cannot be altered or reused
- **Verifiable** â€“ Anyone can scan the QR and check authenticity
- **Decentralized** â€“ No reliance on a single database or authority

## How to Run Locally

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

> ðŸ“„ Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following:

```
SECRET_KEY=your_wallet_private_key_here
```
